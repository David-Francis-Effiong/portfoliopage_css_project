# Project Name: Portfolio Webpage CSS External Styling

In this project, I created a basic webpage for my portfolio. I used HTML to structure the content and include some 
semantic tags and elements like headings, main, section, paragraphs, lists, and footer.

## specifications

- Title inserted (My Portfolio Webpage) using the h1 tag.
- I used the link tag to link the html page with an external css (styles.css) from a specified location.
- There is a nav tag with anchor tags inserted in-line under the header tag.
- I inserted audio and video elements within the page with the controls attribute for both.
- I inserted a form to make it possible for visitors or clients to send me messages.
- I also inserted a photo of myself within the page using the <img> tag with an ordered list mentioning some of my technical skills.
- The input element was used in two places to ensure that users upload their resumes and contact details.
- I added a link at the bottom of the page leading to a contact page (to my LinkedIn) using the <footer> tag.
